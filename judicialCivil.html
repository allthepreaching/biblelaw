      <h3>Judicial / Civil Laws</h3>
      <p>
        Judicial/CIVIL LAW CRIMES Role of Governmental bodies 1. The role of the
        government is giving (fair) punishment to evildoers and to praise those
        that do well; life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
        hand, foot for foot • Deuteronomy 19:21, Proverbs 11:10, 14:34, 20:8,26,
        21:11, 25:5, Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:14 • Three main types of
        punishments: Fines, Death Penalty, and Flogging Death Penalty Crimes
        (Purpose of the death penalty is to make a public example and requires
        extreme evidence: Matthew 1:19. Religious death penalty crimes do not
        point to forced conversion but rather a ban on certain
        religions/practices and citizens are allowed to believe whatever they
        want.) 1. Murder: Genesis 9:6, Exodus 21:12,14,20,22-23,29, Leviticus
        20:2, 24:17, Numbers 35:16-18,21,30, Deuteronomy 19:11-13, 2 Samuel
        12:9, Proverbs 28:17 (Includes abortion: Exodus 21:22-23) 2.
        Man-stealing (kidnapping, illegal slavery, human trafficking): Exodus
        21:16, Deuteronomy 24:7 3. Bestiality: Exodus 22:19, Leviticus 20:15-16.
        4. Sodomy: Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1:32, 2 Peter 2:6 5. Forcing someone
        (Rape): Deuteronomy 22:25-27, Matthew 18:6, Mark 9:42, Luke 17:2 (Note:
        this would also include pedophilia as a type of rape because children
        are legally not able to consent- 1 Corinthians 7:36: she must “pass the
        flower of her age”) 6. Adultery with a married/betrothed woman:
        Leviticus 20:10,20-21 Deuteronomy 22:22-24, Job 31:9-11: stoned to death
        with stones 7. Lying about your virginity to your father and new husband
        (public example): Deuteronomy 22:13-21 8. Incest (in-law or genetic or
        others’ near of kin): Leviticus 18:29, 20:11-12,14,17,20-21 1
        Corinthians 5:1-5: both of them would be burnt with fire 9. Witchcraft
        or Wizardry and belonging to an Occult group: Exodus 22:18, Leviticus
        20:27 10. Worshipping, serving, or sacrificing to false gods (devils,
        idols): Exodus 22:20, Leviticus 18:21, 20:2, Deuteronomy 17:3-5,7, Job
        31:26-28, Ezekiel 9:4-7, 14:10: stone them 11. Teaching to serve other
        gods: Deuteronomy 13:1-11. stone them. 12. Speaking in the name of other
        gods: Deuteronomy 18:20, Ezekiel 14:10 13. Lying about receiving words
        from God (false prophesies): Deuteronomy 18:20-22, Zechariah 13:3 14.
        Blaspheming the name of the LORD: Leviticus 24:16: stone them 15.
