      <h2>REFERENCE SITE</h2>
      <h3>Ceremonial Laws</h3>
      <p>
        CEREMONIAL LAW Note: The New Testament references are verses that
        specifically tell us that these laws have been changed in the New
        Testament. Calendar: feasts, holy days, days, months, times, and years
        1. Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year • Exodus
        23:14, 34:24, Deuteronomy 16:16, Nahum 1:15 • 1st: Exodus 23:14,
        Deuteronomy 16:16; 2nd: Exodus 23:15, 34:22, Deuteronomy 16:16, 3rd:
        Exodus 23:15, 34:22, Deuteronomy 16:13,16 2. All males shall appear
        before the LORD • Exodus 23:17, 34:23, Deuteronomy 16:16 3. Blow the
        Silver Trumpets during solemn feast days and in the beginning of months
        (over burnt offerings and over sacrifices of peace offerings) • Numbers
        10:10, Psalm 81:3 New Testament: Romans: 14:5, 1 Corinthians 5:7,
        Galatians 4:9-10, Colossians 2:14–17, 1 Peter 1:19 Passover (Passover is
        the first day of the feast of unleavened bread: Ezekiel 45:21, Matthew
        26:17-21, Mark 14:12, Luke 22:1,7, Acts 12:3-4) 1. This month (Abib)
        shall be unto you a beginning of months, it shall be the first month of
        the year to you • Exodus 12:2, Deuteronomy 16:1 • Significance: new
        beginning in Christ (Passover) 2. On the 10th day of Abib, take a lamb •
        Exodus 12:3 • Significance: Jesus entered Jerusalem on the 10th 3. Lamb
        must be a first-year male (from sheep or goats) • Exodus 12:5 4. Kill
        the Passover on the 14th in the evening, eat it that night • Exodus
        12:6,8, Leviticus 23:5, Numbers 9:3, 28:16, Deuteronomy 16:2, Ezekiel
        45:21 • Significance: this foreshadows Jesus' crucifixion week; he
        entered Jerusalem on the 10TH, was crucified on the 14TH, and the “whole
        assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it (the first-year
        lamb) in the evening”. The Passover is called a sacrifice in Deuteronomy
        16. 5. Strike Blood on the posts of the door where they eat • Exodus
        12:7,13 • Significance: Jesus sacrificing himself for mankind does mean
        that everyone is saved: you need a personal application of the blood.
        The people with the blood on the doorpost were the ones passed over by
        the angel of death on the first Passover. 6. Eat the Flesh of the
        Passover Lamb with unleavened bread, and bitter herbs (also don’t eat
        leavened bread) (start of 7-day feast) • Exodus 12:8, 13:3, 23:18,
        34:25, Numbers 9:11 • Significance: we symbolically eat the Flesh of
        Jesus in the New Covenant 7. Must be roasted with fire: not raw or
        boiled • Exodus 12:8-9, Deuteronomy 16:7 • Significance: Jesus went to
        hell for three days and three nights (Acts 2:31) 8. His head with his
        legs and with purtenance thereof • Exodus 12:9 • Significance: Jesus’
        whole body was sacrificed 9. Let none of the Passover remain until the
        morning, burn the remains with fire • Exodus 12:10, 23:18, 34:25,
        Numbers 9:12, Deuteronomy 16:4 • Significance: shows that salvation is a
        one-time thing because the Passover represents Jesus and we're only
        supposed to eat of it for one meal and burn the leftovers (so that none
        remains to be eaten thereafter) 10. Eat the Passover with haste and with
        shoes on, loins girded, staff in hand • Exodus 12:11 • Significance:
        shows the children of Israel trusting God to deliver them out of Egypt
        (bondage) into Freedom (Exodus 12:33,42, Deuteronomy 16:12) 11. Feast of
        the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread is to be kept throughout
        all generations forever (a memorial) • Exodus 12:14,17,24, 13:3,10 •
        Significance: it is kept by believers who have received an eternal
        application of Jesus' blood • Egypt is the house of bondage: Exodus
        12:17, 13:3 (13:14) 12. None of you shall go out of his house until the
        morning • Exodus 12:22-23 • Significance: once you were born again in
        Christ you receive eternal life and you can't lose your salvation 13.
        Tell your children of the Passover. • Exodus 12:26-27, 13:8-9,14-15 •
        Significance: This is one verse that aligns with the Bible teaching that
        parents should teach their children the things of God. Education begins
        first at the home, and if a parent leaves their children in the counsel
        of the ungodly they are setting him up for failure concerning wisdom and
        right choice of action 14. Eat the Passover in the house (with the
        appropriate number of people Exodus 12:3-4, same as communion) • Exodus
        12:46 • Significance: pictures communion 15. Don't break the bones of
        the Passover • Exodus 12:46, Numbers 9:12 • Significance: this
        foreshadows Jesus being crucified but did not have his bones broken even
        though it would be customary for the Romans to break the legs to speed
        up the execution. 16. No uncircumcised shall eat of the Passover feast •
        Exodus 12:43-45,48 • Significance: communion is only for the saved 17.
        All the congregation of Israel shall keep it • Exodus 12:47 18. Those
        unclean by reason of touching a dead body, or those travelling abroad,
        shall still keep the Passover on the 14th of the 2nd month • Numbers
        9:10-11 19. Those who are clean and are not traveling abroad at this
        time and don't keep the Passover in the first month shall be cut off
        from the children of Israel • Numbers 9:13 20. Return to your tents in
        the morning Deuteronomy 16:7 Feast of Unleavened Bread 1. The Feast of
        unleavened bread starts on the 15th of Abib (after the 14th day at
        sunset until the 21st day at sunset) • Exodus 12:18, 13:5, Leviticus
        23:6, Numbers 28:17 2. Eat unleavened bread for 7 days: don’t eat
        leavened bread • Exodus 12:15,19-20, 13:3,6-7, 23:15,18, 34:18,25,
        Leviticus 23:6, Numbers 28:17, Deuteronomy 16:3,8, Ezekiel 45:21 •
        Significance: leaven represents sin (1st Corinthians 5:6–8). The reason
        leaven represents sin is because allowing small amounts of leaven
        (yeast) can cause it to spread until our whole life is messed up. •
        Note: we should remove sin from our lives 3. No leaven bread within all
        thy coasts • Exodus 12:19, 13:7, Deuteronomy 16:4 • Note: We should,
        also, remove temptation to sin from our lives 4. Anybody who eats
        leavened bread during the seven days shall be cut off from Israel •
        Exodus 12:15,19 5. A holy convocation (a holyday/holiday) on the 1st
        (Passover) and 7th day: which is kept by doing no servile work on these
        two days • Exodus 12:16, 13:6, Leviticus 23:7-8, Numbers 28:18,25, and
        Deuteronomy 16:8 • Meaning: being holy means to sanctify or set apart 6.
        Significance: Salvation is not of works because each day Jesus was in
        the tomb was a day of rest • The 7th day is a solemn assembly •
        Deuteronomy 16:18 7. Give an offering made by fire unto the Lord for 7
        Days • Leviticus 23:8, Ezekiel 45:22 8. Offer a burnt offering of two

        a sheaf of first fruits of your harvest unto the priest (your first
        fruits have to get there on the 17th for the ceremony) • Leviticus 23:10

        The priests shall wave the sheaf before the Lord • Leviticus 23:11 4.

        green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto

        your generations in all your dwellings • Leviticus 23:14 8. Goes in

        Corinthians 7:18-19, Galatians 2:3-4, 5:2-6, 6:15-16 Clothing Section 1
        1. Fringes: • Numbers 15:38-40, Deuteronomy 22:12 • Significance: This
        is fulfilled because in the New Covenant the Law is written on our
        hearts and not on our clothing. The Holy Spirit indwells NT believers
        and will be a reminder to us instead. 2. And thou shalt bind them for a
        sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
        • Deuteronomy 6:8, 11:18 (this command is figurative: Proverbs 3:3,
        7:2-4) • Significance: This command is spiritual but is often taken as
        literal/physical as Nicodemus did: Proverbs 3:3, 7:2-4, John 3:4 New
        Testament: Jeremiah 31:33, Romans 2:15, Hebrews 10:15-16; John 14:26;
        Matthew 23:5 Section 2 3. Linen and woolen garment • Leviticus 19:19,
        Deuteronomy 22:11 • Significance: This is a picture of mixing grace and
        works (Cain and Abel; Adam and Eve). Clothing is a picture of salvation
        in the bible and believers receive a robe of righteousness from God.
        Those who don’t receive this wedding garment are cast out into hell. New

        those who eat/drink blood • Leviticus 7:27, 17:10,14 12. Whoever eats
        flesh that dies of itself or is torn of beasts shall wash his clothes
        and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the even • Leviticus

        the sun goes down and they must wash themselves: Leviticus 15:31,
        Numbers 5:2-4, Deuteronomy 23:10-11 2. Whoever or whatever touches any
        unclean person or thing becomes unclean (and guilty- it is a sin):
