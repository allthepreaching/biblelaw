    <h3>Moral Laws</h3>
    <p>
      Moral Law
 

BAPTISM

1. Get Baptized
•	Acts 2:38, 10:48
2. Baptize believers (in the name of The Father, and of The Son, and of The Holy Ghost)
•	Matthew 28:19 (this is the job of ordained officials but laymen should still encourage new believers to be baptized)
BIBLE
1. Read the Bible (daily)
•	Deuteronomy 17:19 (Acts 17:11), Isaiah 34:16, 1 Timothy 4:13,  Revelation 1:3
•	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear: Micah 1:2, Matthew 11:15, 13:9,18,43, 15:10, 17:5, Mark 4:3,9,23-24, 7:14,16, Luke 8:8,18 14:35, 18:6, 2 Timothy 2:7, Hebrews 12:25, 13:22, James 2:5, Revelation 2:7,11,17,29, 3:6,13,22
•	The Bible is our spiritual food: Matthew 4:4, Luke 4:4: Deuteronomy 8:3, Ezekiel 2:8, 3:1,3, Revelation 10:9.  Note: Compare amount of time you spend eating to reading or listening to the Bible
2. Do not add or diminish God’s Word
•	Deuteronomy 4:2, 12:32, Proverbs 30:6, Revelation 22:18-19
CEREMONIAL LAW 
1. Understand the distinction between the ceremonial and moral laws
•	Matthew 5:17; Colossians 2:16; 1 Corinthians 7:18; Matthew 9:13 (Matthew 12:7, Hosea 6:6)
CIVIL GOVERNMENT
1. Pay taxes:
•	Matthew 22:21, Mark 12:17, Luke 20:25, Romans 13:7
2. Avoid trouble with the law: by agreeing with thine adversary; handling disputes amongst brethren
•	Matthew 5:25-26,40, Luke 12:57-58, 1 Corinthians 6:1-7
3. Don’t conceal evil doers
•	Deuteronomy 13:8, Proverbs 28:17
COMMUNION
1. Eat unleavened bread in remembrance of Jesus’ body and drink grape juice (fruit of the vine) in remembrance of Jesus’ blood
•	Matthew 26:26-27, Luke 22:19-20, 1 Corinthians 11:24-25
2. This is a small gathering (it’s the new testament version of the Passover)
•	1 Corinthians 11:20 (Luke 22:15)
•	Note: large groups would allow unsaved people to participate to get sick/judged
3. This is a shared meal (must be orderly)
•	1 Corinthians 11:21-22,33-34
4. Do not do this unworthily (A saved person is worthy, because of God’s righteousness: Example of Judas)

DISPUTES

2. Confess your faults one to another
•	James 5:16
3. Yield to judgment from authorities
